# 1 HISTORY OF LINUX 
Hey rookie! So you decided to dive into this wonderful world known as Linux? It’s gonna be a beautiful and enjoyable road ahead! My name is Penguin Pete and I’m here to guide you through this journey. Let’s get started with a little bit of backstory about Linux.

To learn about how Linux came to be, let’s go back to the beginning to 1969 where Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories developed the UNIX operating system. It was later rewritten in C to make it more portable and eventually became a widely used operating system.

A decade or so later, Richard Stallman started working on the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project, the GNU kernel called Hurd, which unfortunately never came to completion. The GNU General Public License (GPL), a free software license, was also created as a result of this.

The kernel is the most important piece in the operating system. It allows the hardware to talk to the software. It also does a whole lot of other things, but we’ll dig into that in a different course. For now, just know that the kernel controls pretty much everything that happens on your system.

During this time other efforts such as BSD, MINIX, etc were developed to be UNIX like-systems. However, one thing that all these UNIX like-systems had in common was the lack of a unified kernel.

Then in 1991, a young fellow named Linus Torvalds started developing what we now know today as the Linux kernel.

# 2 CHOOSING A LINUX  DISTRIBUTION
A Linux system is divided into three main parts:

Hardware - This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.
Linux Kernel - As we discussed above, the kernel is the core of the operating system. It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.
User Space - This is where users like yourself will be directly interacting with the system.
So the first step we’ll need to take is to install Linux on your machine. You have many options to choose from and this course will help inform you and get you started on choosing a Linux distribution.

There are many Linux distributions to choose from, we’ll just go over the most popular options.

# 3 Debian

Debian is an operating system composed entirely of free and open-source software. It’s widely known and has been in development for over 20 years.

Package Management
Debian also uses Debian package management tools. Every Linux distribution installs and manages packages differently and they use different package management tools. We’ll get more into this in a later course.

Configurability
Debian may not get the latest updates, but it's extremely stable. If you want a good "core" operating system, this is the one for you.

Uses
Debian is an overall great operating system for any platform.

# 4 Red Hat Enterprise Linux

![redhat](https://github.com/IOT-Club-Mangu/Linux-Crash-Course/assets/98217039/ec039e09-1629-44a9-b87c-52f22255824e)


Red Hat Enterprise Linux commonly referred to as RHEL is developed by Red Hat. RHEL has strict rules to restrict free re-distribution although it still provides source code for free

Package Management
RHEL uses a different package manager than Debian, RPM package manager, which we will eventually learn about as well.

Configurability
RHEL-based operating systems will differ slightly from the Debian-based operating systems, most noticeably in package management. If you decide to go with RHEL it’s probably best if you know you’ll be working with it.

Uses
As described by the name it's mostly used in enterprise, so if you need a solid server OS this would be a good one
